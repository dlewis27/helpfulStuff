Setting up conda

	curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh > miniconda-installer.sh
	bash miniconda-installer.sh -b
	miniconda3/condabin/conda init
2. close and reopen ubuntu, check everything is working by typing "conda"
3. Add channels with
	conda config --add channels bioconda
	conda config --add channels conda-forge
4. Make a conda enviroment "bioinfo" or whatever you want to call it and add popular software listed by biostars, may need to restart.
	conda create -y --name bioinfo python=3.6
5. Activate evironment (may have to open and close terminal again). You will have to run this everytime you open the terminal to active the enviroment
	conda activate bioinfo
6. Get list of perscribed biostar tools
	curl http://data.biostarhandbook.com/install/conda.txt > biostarToolList.txt
